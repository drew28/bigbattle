Make sure you have flash player 10.  If you'd like to edit the files you must have Adobe Flash CS4.

SpaceShooter.as is the main game file.

Frame 1 Actions for preloader.fla (if no flash): 
I have included z_preloader.fla.as actions from Frame 1 of preloader.fla if you don't have flash cs4.

LevelGenerator:
In order to run LevelGenerator.fla correctly you must have Adobe Air 1.1 installed.  To generate level0.as
(a snippet of code) press the space bar. to change terrain, click a square it will change depending on the
current frame of the MovieClip.  For more information contact me.

To Play:
open: demo.html (checks flash player version for ver. 10)
